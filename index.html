    <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>
    <p>
        In this website I'm gonna post every single practice I've been doing. <br> 
        The purpose of this is for record somehow my progress as a Web Developer. <br>
    </p>

    <p>
        A lot of people told me that I had to create a Github account to upload my stuff, so
        well... I'm here!
    </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        At first, I considered making every single project into a different repo, but <br>
        then I realize it would be more accurate to attach everything into a single <br> 
        one, plus it would look less cluttered. Just imagine how could it had been to <br> 
        upload multiple repos with the same concept, it would be nonsenseless, at <br> 
        least for me.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice that at this point I'm starting to develop some skills such as HTML <br>
        and CSS, so don't expect too much in these projects. They are some basic <br>
        ones with the purpose to comprehend some concepts I needed to understand. 
    </p>

    <h2>My first projects</h2>

    <p>Well, with no more words to add, these are my first little projects:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Little Cat</li>
        <li>My Favorite Band</li>
        <li>Birthday Invitation</li>
    </ol>
