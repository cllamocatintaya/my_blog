    <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>
    <p>
        In this website I'm gonna post every single practice I've been doing. <br> 
        The purpose of this is for record somehow my progress as a Web Developer. <br>
    </p>

        A lot of people told me that I had to create a Github account to upload my stuff, so
        well... I'm here!
